# Spotify-Remove-Ads
A simple script that will mute those pesky spotify ads. Requires spotify's play and speaker buttons visible on the screen to work. You also have to have python installed.

## Install Steps:

1: Clone this repo, or download as a zip file and unzip.

2: Find where your spotify app's .exe file is located. Copy that directory.

3: In the "Remove-Spotify-Ads" folder, open the "start_spotify.bat" file. Paste in the copied directory.

4: (optional) I like to have the "Remove-Spotify-Ads.bat" file on my desktop for easy access. To do this, copy the directory of the "Remove-Spotify-Ads" folder and paste it in the "Remove-Spotify-Ads.bat" file. Also don't forget to remove the :: before cd


Now just double click on "Remove-Spotify-Ads.bat"! It will start, play, unmute and then check for ads. 
### Happy Listening!
